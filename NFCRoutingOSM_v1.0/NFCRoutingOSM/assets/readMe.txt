This folder holds routing information as .osm files and also offline map data as .zip files.
To create .osm-files just download them from openstreetmap.org.
For the .zip files download Mobile Atlas Creator, choose to create a new osmdroid ZIP file and
select the area and zoom levels you want to have supported. When the app is started, all the 
.zip files will be written onto the SD Card and can be processed by the app.
